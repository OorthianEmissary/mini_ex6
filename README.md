Titel: Squirming-and-super-high-on-acid-caterpillars-in-a-displaycase-maker.

Rules:
1. In the beginning, draw a caterpillar.
2. Draw their footsteps.
3. Make them move.
5. When you touch their displaycase, they stop moving.
6. Touching their displaycase too much will make them stop moving at all.

meanwhile, here's a link to the sketch.

On the notion of generative art, this program makes bezier caterpillars. Their location, movement, colour, numbers and sizes are quasi-random within certain limits. In this way I have ceded control of making the actual artwork to the program itself. There's little emergent behavior to the Caterpillars, besides their random movement, which fluctuates and is beyond the users control.
The only interaction the user can do, is stopping what happens on the screen. In itself, the piece is chaotic, having little order, besides the placement of the footsteps in accordance to the caterpillars.
I also resign all authorship of all pieces made with this program. Everything made by this program is not made by any humans, only the program itself. As such, my piece is generative art - made by someone, it's creations taken authorship by no one.
